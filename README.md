# THELMA: Timelock Heuristic Evaluation for Lightning Movement Analysis

THELMA is a research tool that demonstrates how malicious nodes in the Lightning Network could potentially deanonymize payment routes by analyzing HTLC timelock values. It simulates a scenario where multiple colluding nodes in the network observe payment HTLCs and attempt to correlate them based on timelock information.
